==============================

TRANSCRIPT:
This is a live test of Edge Secure for the AMD Slingshot 2026 Challenge.  Our goal is to solve the problem of data privacy in corporate meetings.  Currently companies are afraid to use AI because their data is sent to the cloud.  Edge Secure runs entirely on device using the local GPU and GPU to transcribe and summarize.  The same information without any interconnection, this ensures 100% data sovereignty for legal and medical professionals.

SUMMARY:
- Live test of AMD Slingshot 2026 Challenge EdgeSecure project ongoing.

- Objective: To ensure privacy during corporate meetings with fears related to cloud usage.

- Solution: Edge Secure is an end-to-end solution that operates solely within the device, leveraging local GPU for tasks such as transcribing and summarizing meeting data onsite (edge computing). 

- Data sovereignty ensured without any transmission to remote servers. This satisfies legal professionals' concerns about maintaining confidentiality in their communications by keeping sensitive information within the device itself, preventing potential breaches or unauthorized access that could occur when data leaves its original location (the meeting room).

- Medical professionals also find this solution appealing as it enables them to discuss patient cases securely without risk of exposure. 

- EdgeSecure provides an autonomous, onsite processing platform for AI tasks, eliminating concerns related to external data storage and potential security vulnerabilities associated with cloud computing environments (outsourcing critical infrastructure). This approach helps maintain complete control over the meeting's content flow while ensuring that all relevant information remains accessible solely within EdgeSecure’s ecosystem.

- As a result, companies can confidently use AI technologies to enhance their operations without jeopardizing privacy or legal compliance by keeping sensitive data and processing onsite with 100% device sovereignty.
